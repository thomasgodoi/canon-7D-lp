### Summary
Hello.

This is a simple project using NextJS and pure CSS. I wanted to play with slow motion so I thought it would be fitting to advertise a camera that records in 1000 FPS. Not everything in texts are actual facts, I just wanted to do something better than simply using Lorem Ipsum. 

Any feedback is appreciated. Thank you so much for your attention!
