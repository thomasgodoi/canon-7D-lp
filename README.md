Hello.

This is a simple project about a subject I've been thinking about doing in a while now. I wanted to play with slow motion so I thought it would be fitting to advertise a camera that records in 1000 FPS. I'm adding the icons' Illustrator files in the util folder, if any of you want to make some changes.Any feedback is appreciated!




Thank you so much for your attention,

Thomas Godoi.
